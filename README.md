# About
Do not use this script if you ever plan on not having access to a 12 sidebutton mouse again, because I cannot live without them anymore. You have been warned.

It's not perfect, actually fairly bad code quality due to some of xdotool's and wmctrl's limitations, but it works quite well. Of course it would be fairly trivial to make modifier keys and more Window-dependent hotkeys, but I generally don't need anything more than this. The best hotkeys by far are the tab switching, forwards/backwards in history, new tabs, closing tabs, focusing my terminal, browser and file manager.. so basically everything minus a few exceptions.

Keyboard hotkeys are also useful, but I think in general when invoking these hotkeys I use the mouse more than the keyboard so it makes more sense to have them bound to my mouse.

I use the Corsair Scimitar Pro RGB, though any mouse with 12 side buttons will work fine.
I also use (https://github.com/ckb-next/ckb-next)[ckb-next] for binding the keys to this script. I don't bind the commands directly in ckb-next mainly so I can invoke window specific options, but I do think ckb-next is a brilliant tool I would highly recommend to anyone regardless of what mouse they had.
